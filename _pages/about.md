Ph.D. candidate @ [Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB)](https://www.deib.polimi.it) â€“ [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it).
Part of the [quantum computing initiative](https://www.quantum.polimi.it).

My research, carried out at Politecnico di Milano university, revolves around the quantum computing field.
At the moment, I am focusing on the design, development and cryptanalysis of quantum algorithms to attack Post-Quantum Cryptosystems, with a specific focus on code-based finalists of [NIST competition](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography).
