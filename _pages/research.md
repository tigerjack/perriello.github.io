<h4 id="research-code-interests">quantum computing</h4>

My research revolves around the quantum computing field. At the moment, I am
focusing on the design and development of new algorithms and the analysis of
their complexity.

My Ms.C. thesis was focused on the <em>Information Set Decoding</em> (ISD)
problem, up to now the most efficient attack against cryptosystems based on
linear error-correcting codes. With the help of my advisors, I designed a
quantum version of this of attack, that relies at its core on a modified version
of Grover’s algorithm. The proposed circuit was completely implemented and
tested with linear codes of different sizes using the IBM’s Qiskit framework.

During my months as an intern at Atos, I mainly focused on the exploration of
algorithms for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) architectures, as well as
state-of-the-art simulation techniques targeting low-memory devices. This
study led to the implementation of a novel simulator for
[myQLM](https://myqlm.github.io/).

My Ph.D. research activities, supervised by Prof. [Gerardo
Pelosi](https://pelosi.faculty.polimi.it) and Prof. [Alessandro
Barenghi](https://barenghi.faculty.polimi.it), is centered around quantum
cryptanalysis of <em>Post-Quantum cryptoschemes</em>. The evaluation of new
cryptographic standards capable of resisting attacks from both classical and
quantum accelerated computers is indeed one of the major quest in the
cryptography community. The effort is witnessed by the call for standard carried
out by, among the others, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
[NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography), that is
expected to lead to draft of standards by the end of 2023. Practical evaluation
of the computational complexity required to attack the proposed Post-Quantum
cryptoschemes is fundamental to have practical parameters to tune them.
