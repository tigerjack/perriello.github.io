                  equipped with quantum computers is a major research direction
                  fostered by the US National Institute of Standards and
                  Technology (NIST) Post-quantum Cryptography Standardization
                  process. Among the viable candidates, code-based asymmetric
                  cryptosystems are one of the prominent approaches. In this
                  work, we propose the first fully detailed quantum circuit to
                  compute the solution to the Information Set Decoding problem,
                  the main cryptanalytic tool against such cryptosystems. We
                  evaluate the cryptanalytic effort with our circuit design on
                  actual parameters from cryptosystems admitted to the final
                  stage of the NIST standardization process and compare it with
                  the previous conservative asymptotic estimates. We show that
                  the actual computational effort of our solution is smaller
                  than the one estimated via asymptotics by a factor of \(2^4\) . We
                  also perform a comparison of our results with the
                  quantum-computational effort of breaking the AES cipher,
                  following the guidelines of the US NIST in evaluating the
                  security of the ciphers. To do this, we translate our design
                  on gates of the Clifford+T gate set only, one of the most
                  promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computation,
                  and report that the parameter choices for Classic McEliece and
                  BIKE, two candidates admitted to the final round of the NIST
                  standardization process provide an adequate security margin
                  with respect to our ISD solution technique.},

  abstract = {The significant interest in cryptographic primitives providing
                  sound security margins when facing attacks with quantum
                  computers is witnessed by the ongoing USA National Institute
                  of Standards and Technology Post-quantum Cryptography
                  Standardization process. Sound and precise evaluation of the
                  amount of computation required to break such cryptographic
                  primitives by means of quantum computers is required to be
                  able to choose the cryptosystem parameters. We present a full
                  description of a quantum circuit to accelerate the computation
                  of the solution of the Information Set Decoding problem ,
                  which is currently the best known non-structural attack
                  against code-based cryptosystems. We validate our design
                  running it on small instances of error correction codes, which
                  allowed a complete validation on the AtoS QLM quantum computer
                  simulator. We detail the circuit accelerating the exponential
                  complexity search phase in the Lee and Brickell variant of the
                  ISD solver, and provide its computational complexity for
                  cryptographically relevant parameters taken from the third
                  round candidates in the USA post-quantum standardization

    abstract = {Code-based cryptosystems are a promising option for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), as neither classical nor quantum algorithms provide polynomial time solvers for their underlying hard problem. Indeed, to provide sound alternatives to lattice-based cryptosystems, NIST advanced all round 3 code-based cryptosystems to round 4 of its Post-Quantum standardization initiative. We present a complete implementation of a quantum circuit based on the Information Set Decoding (ISD) strategy, the best known one against code-based cryptosystems, providing quantitative measures for the security margin achieved with respect to the quantum-accelerated key recovery on AES, targeting both the current state-of-the-art approach and the NIST estimates. Our work improves the state-of-the-art, reducing the circuit depth by 219 to 230 for all the parameters of the NIST selected cryptosystems, mainly due to an improved quantum Gauss-Jordan elimination circuit with respect to previous proposals. We show how our Prangeâ€™s based quantum ISD circuit reduces the security margin with respect to its classical counterpart. Finally, we address the concern brought forward in the latest NIST report on the parameters choice for the McEliece cryptosystem, showing that its parameter choice yields a computational effort slightly below the required target level.},
