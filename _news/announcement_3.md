Finally! After a long journey, our research paper has been accepted for
publication at the prestigious *ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing*!

We developed an innovative quantum circuit to implement the Prange variant of
the ISD strategy, accelerating the solution to the Syndrome Decoding Problem
(SDP). By extending and improving upon all the previous works, including our own
previous publication, we enhanced the state-of-the-art in this field.
Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of three code-based
cryptosystems, namely Classic McEliece, BIKE, and HQC, in line with the NIST
Post-Quantum standardization initiative. Our circuit design provides exact
measures for gate count (using different gates basis), qubits, and depth.

All these findings contribute to the ongoing research efforts in post-quantum
cryptography and quantum computing. We aim to drive advancements in secure
communication and pave the way for the development of robust encryption systems
in the face of emerging quantum technologies.

I will publish the open-access version of the paper soon; now it is time to
celebrate!
